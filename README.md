# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git : Code-Rafactory

## Added symantic elements to HTML and cleaned up CSS styling

Below is a guide of what changes were made to these files. As a beginner developer, my goal was to increase the accebility through additional semantic tags and to leave the code cleaner than I found it :)

1. Title renamed to be descriptive and concise

2. Accessibility was upgraded with commments

3. Alt attributes were added to images

4. Class rule sets were consolidated to remove redundancy

5. Div elements were changed to other semantic elements

6. Classes were changed to reflect changes made to div elements

7. Code checked for functionality and verified links were working

8. Updated and completed
